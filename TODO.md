***This is not for the end user, but for the maintainer of this lext-next/lext-artwork-lubuntu repository***
* Find out what the script *artwork/tools/generate_missing_icons.py* is doing (just for curiosity sake)

***Enable ssh transport***
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:lext-next/lext-artwork-lubuntu
